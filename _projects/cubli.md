This project was done as part of the Institute Techincal Summer Projects which happen for freshmen in IIT Bombay at the end of their first year.

As a part of a team of 4, we tried to replicate a Cubli, which was essentially a self-balancing cube. It worked on the principle of angular momentum conservation.

Here is the complete documentation of the project.
